I approach the FizzBuzz problem by utilizing the Chain of Responsibility design pattern.
We can create a chain of handlers, each of which is responsible for checking if a number is divisible by a certain value and then printing the corresponding output.

In this solution, we define a chain of handlers - FizzBuzzHandler, FizzHandler, BuzzHandler, and NumberHandler. Each handler is responsible for checking if a number is divisible by a certain value and returning the corresponding output. We then define the FizzBuzz class, which takes in a number n and loops through the numbers from 1 to n. For each number, it passes the number to the first handler in the chain, and the output is printed.

By using the Chain of Responsibility design pattern, we can easily add or remove handlers as needed, making our code more flexible and modular. Additionally, we are following best practices such as using meaningful variable and function names, commenting our code, and using type hints for clarity.
