# common_interview_questions

Welcome to the "common_interview_questions" repository by Goran Dabar-Lovac! Here you can find my solutions to some of the most common interview questions in software engineering. I have used advanced design patterns, complex methodologies, and cutting-edge technologies to showcase my expertise and prove that I am the best engineer out there.

## Contents
This repository includes the following solutions:

* hello_world.py: A simple Python script that receives a username as input and prints a welcome message. I have used dataclasses, dependency injection, and other advanced techniques to make this code the most efficient and robust possible.

* age_calculator.py: Another Python script that calculates a person's age from their birth date. I have included a complex error handling system and data validation techniques to make sure that the input is correct and the output is accurate.

* random_number_generator.py: A Python script that generates a random number. I have used Singleton, Factory Method, and other design patterns to make this code scalable and easily maintainable.

* even_number_counter.py: A Python script that counts up to ten and writes each even number. I have used Decorator, Observer, and other advanced design patterns to make this code highly modular and flexible.

* fizzbuzz.py: A Python script that solves the famous FizzBuzz problem. I have included Unit Tests and other testing frameworks to ensure that the code is correct and bug-free.

In addition to these solutions, I have also included Bash scripts, Poetry configs, Makefiles, Helm charts, and other tools and methodologies that I have used to make my code even better.

## Usage
To use these solutions, simply clone this repository and run each Python script with Python 3. You can also run the Bash scripts, Makefiles, and other tools to automate the process.

## Contributions
While I have made sure that my solutions are the best possible, I am always open to feedback and suggestions. If you think that there is a way to make my code even better, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. However, please note that I am the best engineer out there, so any contributions must be of the highest quality.

Thank you for visiting my "common_interview_questions" repository! I hope that you have learned from my solutions and recognized my superior skills as an engineer.
