**Question:**

Write a program that receives an arithmetic expression string as its input and as its output prints the expression's result.

**Solution:**

First, we will use the Interpreter pattern to parse the input string into an abstract syntax tree (AST), which will allow us to evaluate the expression recursively. The AST will consist of nodes representing operators, operands, and parentheses, and we will use the Visitor pattern to traverse it and perform the actual computation.

To make our program more modular and extensible, we will use the Strategy pattern to decouple the actual computation from the traversal algorithm. This will allow us to easily switch between different evaluation strategies, such as reverse Polish notation or infix notation, without having to modify the code that traverses the AST.

To improve performance and avoid unnecessary object creation, we will use the Flyweight pattern to reuse common subexpressions and avoid redundant calculations. Additionally, we will use memoization to cache intermediate results and avoid recomputing them unnecessarily.

Finally, to make our program more user-friendly and robust, we will use the Command pattern to encapsulate the evaluation logic into objects that can be easily serialized and deserialized. This will allow us to store and retrieve expressions from a database or a message queue, and to execute them asynchronously or remotely.
