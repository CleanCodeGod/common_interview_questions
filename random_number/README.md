**Question:**
Write a program to display a random number.

**Solution:**
Ah, the humble task of generating a random number. At first glance, this may seem like a simple task, but as a seasoned software engineer, I always strive for elegance and efficiency in my code.

* To achieve this, I use the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of the random number generator is created throughout the entire program's lifespan. This will improve the performance and ensure that the random number generator is not initialized multiple times unnecessarily.

* Next, I use the Observer pattern to implement a mechanism that will allow other parts of the program to receive notifications whenever a new random number is generated. This will promote loose coupling and ensure that the code remains modular and scalable.

* Finally, I use the Decorator pattern to add some additional functionality to the random number generator. Specifically, I will create a decorator that will allow the user to specify the range of the random numbers that should be generated. This will improve the flexibility and usability of the program.

As you can see, my solution is both elegant and efficient. The use of the Singleton design pattern ensures that the random number generator is only initialized once, while the Observer pattern promotes loose coupling and modularity. The Decorator pattern adds an extra layer of functionality to the random number generator, making it more flexible and user-friendly.

In summary, my solution may be more complex than a simple call to the random.randint() function, but it is much more powerful and sophisticated, reflecting my expertise as a software engineer.
